    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical 1PPR Scoring) with an extra .5PPR for TE's.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. There is no real reason to do so for draft position reasons as draft picks are determined by max points for, so your losing record doesn't help you in getting a better draft picks. The only thing it can cause is potentially giving other teams unfair advantages in determining playoff seeding. Multiple offenses of not setting a lineup can result in draft pick foritures or worse if it is habitual. There will be plenty of warning before it reaches this point.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, confirmed collusion, or just being a huge asshole who no one wants to play with any more, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally not grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commissioner will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Refunds</h3>
    <p>If a manager wishes to leave the league, has paid for the upcoming season, and the league has not started yet, a refund may be requested assuming we can find a replacement for the manager that is willing to take on the cost of the upcoming season. Due to the nature of dynasty and a team's situation, this may not always be an option as the team may be in state where it's impossible to find someone to take over the current team. We will make every effort to try and accomodate a refund request - but there is not guarantee here. If the manager has traded away future picks, no refunds will be issued in order to prevent teams from trading away their picks in order to win now and leave the league.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at $50. Dues are collected through <a href="https://www.leaguesafe.com/league/3949641">LeagueSafe</a> and collection will be sent out no later than the first of August. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of regular season. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, a 10% penalty will be addd to their payment and will go towards the payouts at the end of the year.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
